Overview
The Stock Market Analysis and Prediction project focuses on analyzing historical stock data to identify trends, visualize patterns, and predict future stock prices using machine learning models. This project leverages various technical indicators and prediction techniques to assist in making informed investment decisions.

Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stock data to uncover trends and patterns.
Implement technical indicators to enhance predictions.
Build and evaluate machine learning models to forecast stock prices.
Visualize key insights to support investment decisions.
Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Load historical stock data.
Handle missing values and clean the dataset.
Create new features using technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze stock trends and seasonal patterns.
Visualize stock price movements using line charts and candlestick plots.
Feature Engineering

Create lag features to capture past stock movements.
Generate indicators such as Moving Average, Bollinger Bands, and RSI.
Model Building

Implement machine learning models like:
Linear Regression
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks
Random Forest Regressor
Split the data into training and testing sets for validation.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate models using mean squared error (MSE), R² score, and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Plot predictions against actual values for visual comparison.
Visualization

Use charts to compare predicted vs. actual stock prices.
Highlight key trends and market insights.
Key Concepts
Moving Average: Smooths price data to identify trends.
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Measures momentum and overbought/oversold conditions.
LSTM Networks: A deep learning model capable of capturing time dependencies in stock data.
Bollinger Bands: A volatility indicator used to identify overbought/oversold signals.
